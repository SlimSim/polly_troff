An explanation of the functions that will be called.
All these functions sould exist in all of my components (atleast the big ones)

ready:
  standard Polymer thing
  gets called when the polymer/page is loaded (sort of like document load)

recall:
this method should clear the state of the polymer from the old song,
as well as, when possible, load the saved values for the next song.



setSongMetadata:
this method should load the data that can not be displayed untill the
song metadata is accessable, such as the song-duration, and the markers...
